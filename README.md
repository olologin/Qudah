=====
Alarm which plays specified song on specified time with random offset in minutes (Specified by variation parameter).
Also it's posible to hide it from menus (Just call *# in standart dialer to do this).

###Explaination of requested permissions:
- PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS - used only to intercept and dismiss call to *#
- RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - used to set alarm after system boot

For developers: It may be useful for beginners in android programming like me.
In this project you can see examples of intercepting call to specified phone number, 
example of hiding app from menu with android's standart PackageManager and example
of using AlarmManager.
